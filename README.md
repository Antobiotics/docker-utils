# docker-utils

Selfish-ware.
Docker swarm and AWS helpers.

- Useless for 99.99999% of the people.
- I was sick of struggling with docker for every project I'm starting and I can't remember shit.
- Very specific to my (limited) knowledge of Docker and my uses of it.
- Probably gonna give up maintaining it as soon as a new hipster tech solving the same problem goes out.
- Naive and absolutely not generic.

It basically simplifies the process of using Docker Swarm and
helpers to avoid typing long chains of arguments.

- Create a swarm master
- Create machines with different roles and configurations
- Force rebuild if already exist
- SSH
- Describe instances
- Apply
